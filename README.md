### Hey 👋

🤓 I'm currently a 3rd year CS student at the University of Waterloo

👩🏻‍💻 I'm currently working on improving my backend stack and helping create a Canadian dashboard for a COVID-19 mortality simulator (more into here: https://nafshordi.com/covid/)

🔭 I have a deep love and interest for astronomy, sports, music, law, and the outdoors!

📬 You can reach me at jolene.zheng@uwaterloo.ca, I'd love to hear from you :)
