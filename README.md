### Hi there 👋

🤓 I'm currently a 3rd year CS student at the University of Waterloo

👩🏻‍💻 I'm currently working on improving my backend stack, and redesigning my personal website (stay tuned👀)

🔭 I have a deep love for astronomy, sports, music, and the outdoors!

📬 You can reach me at jolene.zheng@uwaterloo.ca about anything. I'd love to hear from you :)
