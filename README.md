### Hi there 👋

🤓 I'm currently a CS student at the University of Waterloo!

👩🏻‍💻 I'm currently working on creating a tiny search engine in C++, and redesigning my personal website (stay tuned👀)

🔭 I have a deep love for the outdoors, music, and astronomy!

📬 You can reach me at jolene.zheng@uwaterloo.ca about anything! I'd love to hear from you :)
